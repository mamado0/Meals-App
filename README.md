# Meals-App
This App is build by flutter 
Here I used the flutter navigator to switch between pages (push/pop/replace)
I used the named and unnamed routes 
Added tabs to the appbar, tabs allows us to switch between different stacks.
Passing data between pages through arguments 
Passing data back through future
Data can be anything(strings, ints, and objects)
Drawers to switch between different stacks.
Drawers and other dialogs(eg. alerts, and modal bottom sheet and closing it by the navigator.pop()
